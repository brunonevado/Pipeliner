# run art, single end, 50 bp read length, average coverage 10
# note that this will result in an average coverage of 20
# because there will be 2 sequences on the infile fasta (diploid individuals)
# also, -o tempfile.art is not the outfile, but rather the prefix for all outfiles


art_illumina -i infile.fas -l 50 -f 10 -o tempfile.art

# art adds file extensions on its on, so now we need to move the resulting
# fastaq file into the expected outfile.fq

mv tempfile.art.fq outfile.fq
